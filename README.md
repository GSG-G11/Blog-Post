## About The Project
![[Product Name Screen Shot]](https://i.imgur.com/qwfih54.png)

There are many blog post website available on Internet; however, We didn't find one that really suited our needs, so We created this enhanced one. We want to make you feel free in our website so we made it that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* You need to feel free with post everything you want, without any restrict.

### User Journey

* When you open our site, you will be faced with a button that will lead you to blogs that have been shared by registered people, and this will only happen if you have an account on our site, so you need to subscribe with us.
* When you register, you can see all blogs. Also, you can write your own blog and share it with people.
* If you close our site without logout, and open it again, you don't need to login again, JUST click ```Start Posting``` button and enjoy ðŸ˜Š.
* Also you can delete your own posts.
